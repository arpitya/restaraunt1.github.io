## What I had taken to build this website

- ### **Created the structure with ````HTML````** - 
  The first thing you have to learn, is ``HTML``, the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- ### **Styled with ``CSS``** -  
    The next step is to learn ``CSS``, to set the layout of your web page with beautiful colors, fonts, and much more.
- ### **Interactive with ``JavaScript``** - 
    After studying ``HTML`` and ``CSS``, you should learn ``JavaScript`` to create dynamic and interactive web pages for your users.
